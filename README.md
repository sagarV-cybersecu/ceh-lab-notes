# Network and Cybersecurity Building Blocks

## Introduction  
This is about **Certified Penetration Testing** and later moving to the **advanced level of penetration testing**.  
Covers knowledge about penetration testing and cybersecurity fundamentals.  

Topics covered:  
- Network  
- Networking Devices  
- Basic Terminologies  
- OSI Model  
- Protocols  
- IP and Subnetting  
- TCP and UDP  
- Docker  
- Active Directory  
- LDAP  
- Kerberos  

---

## 1. Network  
- A network is devices connected together to share data.  
- Example: LAN (local), WAN (wide), Internet (global).  

---

## 2. Networking Devices  
- **Router** → connects networks.  
- **Switch** → connects devices inside LAN.  
- **Hub** → sends data to all ports (old device, not secure).  
- **Firewall** → provides security by filtering traffic.  

---

## 3. Basic Terminologies  
- **IP Address** → unique number for a device in the network.  
- **MAC Address** → hardware address of NIC (network card).  
- **Subnet** → dividing network into smaller logical parts.  
- **Port** → number used by applications for communication.  

---

## 4. OSI Model  
7 layers (bottom → top):  
1. Physical  
2. Data Link  
3. Network  
4. Transport  
5. Session  
6. Presentation  
7. Application  

---

## 5. Protocols  
- HTTP / HTTPS  
- FTP / SFTP  
- DNS  
- DHCP  
- ICMP  

---

## 6. IP & Subnetting  
- **IPv4** → 32-bit (example: 192.168.1.1).  
- **IPv6** → 128-bit (newer, bigger address space).  
- **Subnetting** → breaking network into smaller networks for efficiency/security.  

---

## 7. TCP and UDP  
- **TCP** → connection-oriented, reliable, slower (examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP).  
- **UDP** → connectionless, fast, not reliable (examples: DNS, VoIP, Streaming).  

---

## 8. Docker  
- Containerization tool.  
- Runs applications in isolated environments.  
- Useful for building labs in penetration testing.  

---

## 9. Active Directory (AD)  
- Microsoft directory service.  
- Manages users, computers, groups, and permissions.  
- Common target in penetration testing (privilege escalation, lateral movement).  

---

## 10. LDAP  
- Stands for **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**.  
- Used for accessing and managing directory services like AD.  

---

## 11. Kerberos  
- Network authentication protocol.  
- Works with **tickets** for secure communication.  
- Default authentication in Windows AD.  

---

## Next Steps  
- Study penetration testing methodology in detail.  
- Practice labs with Virtual Machines and Docker.  
- Simulate attacks on Active Directory environments.
